DB to frontend
===================================
Servlet
Tomcat


Front Controller Design Pattern
we have a master servlet.

-------    http	   --------    		  mmm
|        |  	  	  |          |    		  |~~~~|
|____|  	  	  |_____| 	   		  |~~~~|
abc.com					  uuuuu     
 					  (Database)
HTML     					  username, passwd, id
CSS
JS
		WEB CONTAINER
		master servlet - methods used in conjunction with web.xml onto request mapping.
		request mapping/helper - used for routing by URI.
		controller- (business logic) --> calls/talk to DAO --> talk to DAOImpl
		controller - (business logic) ...same as above.


website (abc.com) allows client to complete/submit a form (<form> <method="POST">..) which activates the servlet. servlet uses corresponding post method. the master servlet handles the method and passes to request mapping/helper (which is a switch case) INTO the controller.

separation of concerns - important for pinpointing whats wrong when something happens. or to change things precisely when needed and not making code completely dependent.

POST method is handled by the master servet.

session - when we log in our information is stored in cookies and can be loaded accordingly. to do that we have to set a session and then get the parameters. when they log out we clear the cookies and end the session. (we wont close in class).
