The login for superuser is:
Username: superuser
password: superuser


There are 4 types of accounts:
Customer
Employee
Admin
Superuser

Superusers can create other users, and can specify the account type
i.e. a superuser can create an admin or even another superuser

If you don't want to create an employee or admin using the superuser, login for
Employee:
username: littlefinger
password: littlefinger

admin:
username: varys
password: varys

Superuser vs Admin
I felt that admin dealt more with the bank administation, i.e. bank accounts and such
while the superuser dealt more with the database and the administration of the 
data
Admin can do things with bank accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer
while superuser can create, update and delete users
When the superuser deletes a user, it deletes all information pertaining to that user
all transactions regarding that user
all accounts belonging solely to that user (i.e, if a joint account still has an existing holder it wont be deleted)
relationships in junction table connecting the user to its accounts
and the user itself
